# Introduction

## What is DNS?
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so we donâ€™t have to remember IP address for example of google.com (172.217.16.206).

## Demonstration

### Examples for DNS

* www.google.com. (172.217.16.206)
* Root - .
* TLD - top level domain in this case is com.
* Domain name - google
* Subdomain -www.
* FQDN - fully qualified domain name in this case is www.google.com
