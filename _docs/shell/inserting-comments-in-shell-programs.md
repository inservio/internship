When writing programs, it often happens that you do not have a clear program code that was logical six months ago.
In order to make our programs easier, we mark comments. We enter the comments in the shell programs by setting a special character (#).
When a shell interpreter sees a character (#), it considers the whole text as a commentary to the end of the line.
